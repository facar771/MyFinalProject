Parts used in the system;

- Nema 17 Step motor (4 pieces)
- A4988 Step motor driver (4 pieces)
- Sg 90 Servo motor (1 piece)
- 5v regulator board (1 piece)
- NodeMCU ESP8266 board (1 piece)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (1 piece)
- 3D Parth

I soldered it to the perforated board so that the system I set up with the esp8266 card would look neat.
The project can be controlled with the arduino CNC shield to be systematic, but since this is a ready-made system, I preferred the complex way.
